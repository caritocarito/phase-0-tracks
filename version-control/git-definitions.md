# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch provides a copy of your project to work on. You could switch between branches depending on what you felt like working on. Once complete, you could merge it back into the original project. Branching allows you to discard a feature or experiment that didn't turn out quite as hoped.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
The commit message describes a save point for future reference. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
Sometimes you get merge conflicts when merging or pulling from a branch. Git will then tell you something "Conflict". It also tell you to fix the conflicts and then to commit the result.
